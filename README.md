# Course Review Web Application
This is a course review web application where people can share their experience studying a free course online. Since there are lots of free courses online nowadays, this web application is used to share reviews. While there are web courses that have their own reviews, like Coursera or EdX, some of those reviews are biased. With this web application, honest criticism are given by users and it will push the boundaries of education. Future course takers are going to be more informed on the course they are going to take, whether the course will be valuable or not. Due to the lack of time, at this moment, the web application only has a small database of courses.

This web app is written using Flask. The database is kept on a Heroku Postgresql database.
